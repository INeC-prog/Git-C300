- 👋 Hi, I’m @INeC-prog
- 👀 I’m interested in psychopathology of the emotional brain
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to evaluate the individual susceptibility to emotional changes permissive to the development of mental disorders
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development of behavioral and physiological paradigms that can detect these alterations.
- 📫 I´m based on the Instituto de Neurociencias e Comportamento (INeC), located in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.
